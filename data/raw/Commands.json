  "Usage[edit | edit source]": [
    "In the client, commands are entered via the chat window, which is displayed by pressing the T / ‌[BE  only] / ‌[BE  only] or / key. Using the / key also enters the forward-slash that commands require as a prefix, so it is a useful shortcut. The ↑ /  and ↓ /  keys can be used to view previously entered text, including all previously executed commands.",
    "When the cursor is at a location corresponding to some types of argument (such as an entity ID), a list of applicable values appears above the text box. If the argument already contains characters, the list displays only those values containing the typed text. Pressing Tab ↹ while entering commands cycles through possible commands or arguments, and can be used to auto-enter them.",
    "Commands may also be entered in a multiplayer server's console but are not preceded by a / when entered this way. A server owner running commands in this way is often referred to as \"ghosting\".",
    "Commands in command blocks can be preceded by a slash, but it is not required.",
    "Commands can be executed in the following ways:",
    "Entered by a player in the chat screen.\nExecuted by a command block or a minecart with command block.\nIn a dedicated server, entered in the console.\nIn functions, in a data pack‌[JE  only] or behavior pack‌[BE  only].\nClicking a text component that has \"run_command\" action.‌[JE  only]\nRequested by a WebSocket server connected to a client.‌[BE  only]\nBy an NPC dialogue.‌[BE  only]\nIn scripts, in a behavior pack‌[BE  only].\nIn animation controllers, in a behavior pack‌[BE  only].\nIn a block event response, in a behavior pack‌[BE  only].\nIn an entity event response, in a behavior pack‌[BE  only]."

  "Commands guide[edit | edit source]": [],
  "Syntax[edit | edit source]": [
    "In both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, square bracket decorator ([entry]) mean that an entry is optional. Entries decorated with square brackets can only be at the end of a command. Multiple entries decorated with square brackets are allowed at the end of a command, for example, a [b] [c] at the end of a command indicates that only a, a b, and a b c are valid."
  ],
  "Restrictions[edit | edit source]": [
    "Most commands require the executor to have a high enough permission level. That means most commands are only available in the singleplayer world if cheats are enabled, and are only available in multiplayer servers if the player is an operator. See permission level for details.",
    "Some commands have restrictions on who can use the command or in what context.",
    "None: The command has no restriction.\nCheats only‌[BE  only]: Applicable only to Bedrock Edition. When executed by the server, or a script, the command is available no matter whether cheats are enabled. (Commands from the console, a scheduled function or a ticking function are executed by the server.) When executed in other ways, the command is available only if cheats are enabled. When cheats are disabled, these commands can't be used unless executed by a server or a script, even if the executor has a high permission level.\nIn Java Edition, whether cheats are enabled only affects the permission level of a player. If an executor has a high enough permission level, it can use corresponding commands regardless of whether cheats are allowed.\nDedicated server only: The command is available only on dedicated servers.\nNo dedicated server: The command is not available on dedicated servers.",
    "In Java Edition, whether cheats are enabled only affects the permission level of a player. If an executor has a high enough permission level, it can use corresponding commands regardless of whether cheats are allowed."
  ],
  "Cheats[edit | edit source]": [
    "Cheats can be enabled when creating a new world by Allow Commands‌[Java Edition  only] / Cheats‌[Bedrock Edition  only] options.",
    "In Java Edition, the \"Allow Commands\" option when creating a new world only affects the player in a singleplayer world or the owner of a LAN world. The \"Allow Commands\" option when opening a LAN world affects all players in the LAN world.",
    "In Java Edition, in singleplayer worlds where cheats were not enabled at creation, they can be enabled on a temporary basis by opening the current game session to LAN play ( Esc → \"Open to LAN\", then \"Allow Cheats\" button and \"Start LAN World\"). The player does not actually need to be on a LAN or have others join. This is not permanent but allows the use of commands until the player quits the world, and changes the player makes via commands (items spawned, etc.) are saved with the world. The player can do this each time the player starts playing the world again. Note that this disables game pausing for the duration, so while open to LAN, the player should get somewhere safe or reload their world before using the Game Menu. The player can disable the LAN world by reloading the world. To permanently enable cheats, the level.dat file has to be edited.",
    "In Bedrock Edition, cheats can be toggled at any time in the \"Cheats\" tab of the settings menu. Enabling cheats in a world permanently prevents players from unlocking achievements in that world, even if cheats are later turned off. In Bedrock Dedicated Server, /changesetting command can be used to toggle cheats."

  "Argument types[edit | edit source]": [
    "There are different argument types for arguments in commands. Coordinates, target selector, SNBT, text component, and so on are commonly used formats in arguments."
  ],
  "Parsing and execution[edit | edit source]": [
    "The command performing on the server side is divided into two stages: command parsing and command execution. During the command parsing stage, the game identifies the string as a command and checks whether the command is complete and whether arguments are specified correctly. During the command execution stage, the command fulfills its purpose.",
    "When typing a command in the chat, or command block, the command is also be parsed in the client side first to provide autocompletion and help the player detect typing mistakes.",
    "In Bedrock Edition, when entering into a command block, the command is parsed on the server side once the command block screen is closed. If the command is unparseable in the server side, a syntax error message is outputted into its output box.",
    "When attempting to execute an unparseable command, an error message is displayed.",
    "Commands in functions are all parsed when loading the function. If any command in a function file is unparseable, the function cannot be loaded by the game. In Java Edition, macro lines are parsed when attempting to run the function, see also Function (Java Edition) § Macros and Function (Java Edition) § Loading and parsing.",
    "In Bedrock Edition, if a command in a script is unparseable, an error is thrown when trying to execute the command."
  ],
  "Output[edit | edit source]": [
    "After trying to execute a command, it may yield output values, including success count and stored values‌[Java Edition  only].",
    "Success count is the value a command passes to the command block executing it. A command block can power a redstone comparator facing away from it (may be separated by a block) with signal strength being the success count. The signal strength reflects the success count of the last command executed. Even after the command block is deactivated, the success count is retained until the command is executed again. In Bedrock Edition, the success count is also returned to the script executing the command. In Java Edition, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks have no success count. In Bedrock Edition, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks or scripts still have a success count, but it cannot be obtained. In Java Edition, success count is always 0 or 1, except the /execute command. In Bedrock Edition, success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (both inclusive) related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, etc.)",
    "Stored values‌[JE  only] include success value and result value, which are the values passed by other commands to the /execute command, when a command is executed by a /execute command. These two values can be stored to a specified location by the store subcommand in the /execute command. The success value is always 0 or 1. The result value is an integer (rounded down if not). All commands may yield these two stored values after execution, with only two exceptions: /execute command itself does not yield these two stored values; /function command may not yield these two stored values in certain situation."
  ],
  "Result[edit | edit source]": [
    "After trying to execute a command, it has a certain result. Possible results include \"Unparseable\", \"Failed\", \"Successful\", \"Void\"‌[JE  only], \"Terminated\"‌[JE  only], and \"Error\"‌[JE  only]."

  "Hidden commands[edit | edit source]": [
    "These commands are unavailable in general cases. Most of them can be accessed with a Websocket Server, NPC, or the Scripting API. Note: You can easily check if a command is still in the game by typing /help <nameOfCommand> into a server console, or the ingame chat. If you do so, and it says syntax error, then the command does not exist. If it either gives help on the command or says unknown command, then it is still in the game - for example, the command /help gettopsolidblock will return Unknown command: gettopsolidblock. Please check that the command exists and that you have permission to use it., while the command /help something will return Syntax error: Unexpected \"something\" at \"/help >>something<<\"."
