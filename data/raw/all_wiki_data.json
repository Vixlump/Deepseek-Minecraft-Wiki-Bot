    "Introduction": [
      "Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios, a part of Xbox Game Studios. Initially released as what is now known as Minecraft Classic on May 17, 2009, the game was fully released on November 18, 2011, after multiple updates. Since its release, Minecraft has expanded to mobile devices and consoles.",
      "Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with and modify a dynamically-generated world made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs and items. Some activities in the game include building, mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations and artwork on various competitive or collaborative multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End and defeat the ender dragon.",
      "From its creation, Minecraft was developed almost exclusively by Swedish game developer Markus \"Notch\" Persson until Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten took place of the head of its development. On November 6, 2014, Minecraft and all of Mojang Studios' assets were acquired by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion.[7][8] Notch has since left Mojang and is no longer working on the game. Minecraft features music by Daniel \"C418\" Rosenfeld, Kumi Tanioka, Lena Raine, Samuel Åberg, Aaron Cherof, Amos Roddy and Hyper Potions, as well as paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand and Sarah Boeving."

    "Gameplay[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Player[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player is the person that the user controls in the world. When the user starts a game, the player is put in a world, generated from a random or specified seed, with an empty inventory. If the bonus chest option is enabled, a chest filled with basic items generates near the player. The player has a health bar with 10 hearts and can be depleted when they are damaged. Damage to health can be mitigated by armor or the Resistance effect; while health can be restored by keeping the hunger bar full enough or by drinking specific potions. If the difficulty is set to Peaceful, health regenerates on its own.",
      "Each player can have a unique look via 9 default skins, or by creating their own custom skin. A player can change their skin on the profile page of Minecraft.net or in the Minecraft Launcher in Java Edition and in the pause or main menus in Bedrock Edition."
    ],
    "Blocks[edit | edit source]": [
      "The world of Minecraft takes place within a three-dimensional grid of cubes, with each cube being occupied by a certain type of block, not all of which are necessarily cubic. There are different types of blocks; natural blocks such as grass, stone and ores that generate randomly within the world. There are also blocks that players can craft, such as a crafting table and a furnace. Resources can be extracted from blocks by hand or by using tools. Some of these resources are simply blocks in the player's inventory that can be placed elsewhere, while others are used as material to create other blocks or tools. Others yield no practical use whatsoever. Some blocks cannot be broken through normal Survival means, e.g. bedrock, End portal frames, command blocks, Nether and End portals, barriers and air."
    ],
    "Mining[edit | edit source]": [
      "Mining is one of the main aspects of Minecraft and is done to extract ore and other materials mainly from below the surface of the map. These ores include coal, iron, gold, redstone, diamond, lapis lazuli, copper and emerald. Mining can involve digging a hole from the surface or going down through a cave. Mineshafts and ravines create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores."
    ],
    "Crafting and smelting[edit | edit source]": [
      "Crafting allows players to create new tools and blocks using items from their inventory. Subsequent versions often contain crafting recipes for new blocks and items. A player can use the 2×2 grid in the inventory or the 3×3 grid provided by a crafting table to craft. Smelting requires a furnace in addition to fuel and processes blocks into a more useful form such as from raw iron into iron ingots, which can then be crafted into iron tools and iron armor."
    ],
    "Brewing and enchanting[edit | edit source]": [
      "Brewing creates potions from various ingredients and water using a brewing stand. They are stored in a glass bottle and then consumed by the player or thrown at other mobs to generate a certain effect based on the magical ingredients used to create the potion. Enchanting is also used to upgrade armor, tools or weapons with an enchanting table or anvil. More powerful enchantments can be accessed by gaining experience and placing bookshelves around the enchanting table."
    ],
    "Mobs[edit | edit source]": [
      "Mobs (short for \"mobiles\") are interactable creatures that inhabit the world. Hostile mobs attack the player while passive mobs do not. Neutral mobs attack when provoked (not all neutral mobs are provoked the same way).",
      "The Overworld contains many passive animal mobs that may be killed for food, bred with one another, or kept around for useful utilities. Mobs that drop food drop the raw version of their food unless killed while on fire or by an item enchanted with the Fire Aspect enchantment."
    ],
    "The Nether[edit | edit source]": [
      "The Nether is a dimension in Minecraft accessible from the Overworld by a Nether portal. It consists of five unique biomes, which are the Nether wastes, the basalt deltas, the crimson and warped forests and the soul sand valleys. Each biome has unique generation and terrain. It is populated by zombified piglins, blazes, ghasts, wither skeletons, magma cubes, piglins, and hoglins. Ores in the Nether include Nether quartz, Nether gold and ancient debris. The Nether also has large oceans of lava that have striders walking on them."
    ],
    "The End[edit | edit source]": [
      "The End is another dimension of the game where the player battles the ender dragon. The End is accessed by entering an End portal found in a stronghold. The End is composed of End stone and is inhabited by endermen. It also contains tall obsidian pillars on top of which are End crystals that heal the ender dragon. Once the ender dragon is slain, the exit portal is created in the center of the map and an End gateway portal is created near an edge of the map, which transports the player to the expansive outer End islands which are full of chorus fruit forests and End cities filled of chest loot and shulkers. The End gateway portal is only accessed by throwing an ender pearl, using elytra or trapdoors to enter the portal. There are no ores in the End."
    ],
    "Multiplayer[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft can be played with multiple players together in one world. Players can interact with each other using the chat or emotes, and can play the game together or damage each other, also known as PvP (player versus player)."
    ],
    "Local connections[edit | edit source]": [
      "Players on the same local network (LAN) can join other worlds opened for LAN connections. The world is hosted and managed by the player running the world, who is also the operator with the ability to manage each player's permissions or kick players. In Bedrock Edition, players can also join worlds opened to the Internet using the Xbox friend system. A player can add and manage friends from the in-game menus or the Xbox app, and any player can be invited to the world."
    ],
    "Server[edit | edit source]": [
      "Multiplayer worlds can also be hosted independently from a player's Minecraft instance using an external server. Official server software for both editions can be downloaded for free on a PC, or a player could use an unofficial server-hosting service that maintains and runs the server. Players can join any external server via the Internet (except for console versions of Bedrock Edition), and the server can even be online while no players are in the world. An official server list has been made for some large third-party servers that provide access for any player, and players can also join specific featured servers in Bedrock Edition.",
      "Minecraft multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their administrators and moderators. The term griefer, meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet but has taken up its definition on Minecraft servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users' creations on servers.",
      "One popular game on multiplayer servers is Spleef (a play on the word \"grief\"), a game where the player aims to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent's feet. This is typically played in a designated area and is usually run automatically using server plugins.",
      "Many popular multiplayer servers exist that may contain, PvP arenas, custom minigames or large Survival or Creative worlds."
    ],
    "Minecraft Realms[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft Realms is an official subscription-based server hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private Minecraft multiplayer worlds. Hosted by Mojang Studios, Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the internet. However, Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.[9] Private Realms servers are easy to set up and available 24/7 as long as the owner pays for it."
    ],
    "Purchase and availability[edit | edit source]": [
      "Java Edition is mostly available on personal computers running Windows, macOS and Linux. It can be purchased from minecraft.net or the Microsoft Store. Gift codes can be bought for others, for the same price as buying the game for oneself. The demo version can be played for free without multiplayer. Java Edition can not run on Windows RT, it can only be run on ChromiumOS or ChromeOS if the \"Linux development environment\" is turned on, and it can not be run on many non-PC devices, even ones that use Java, such as cars and toasters.[10]",
      "Bedrock Edition is available on most devices. It can be purchased on Google Play (for ChromeOS & Android), the Apple App Store (for iOS & iPadOS), the Amazon Appstore (for Fire tablets), the Microsoft Store (for Windows & Xbox), minecraft.net (for Windows), the Nintendo eShop (for Nintendo Switch), and the PlayStation Store (for PS4 & PS5).",
      "Alternatively, Xbox Game Pass Premium and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate provides access to Java Edition on PC and Bedrock Edition on Windows PCs and Xbox consoles. PC Game Pass provides access to Java Edition on PC and Bedrock Edition on Windows PCs.",
      "Both editions on PC or Bedrock Edition on consoles can also be purchased alongside Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Legends, and 1020 Minecoins/Tokens as part of the Minecraft Triple Bundle offer.",
      "The Legacy Console Editions can be purchased on physical media (excluding Nintendo Switch Edition) or on the respective platform's online store. The PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita editions can only be purchased through the console. The Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4,  Wii U, and Nintendo Switch editions are no longer available for direct digital purchase.",
      "The North American version of New Nintendo 3DS Edition can be purchased on physical media. It is no longer available for direct digital purchase.",
      "Minecraft Classic, a remake of an old version of Java Edition, can be played at classic.minecraft.net for free."
    ],
    "Editions[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Java Edition[edit | edit source]": [
      "in Java Edition, there are no special features in the skins. This version has only the features listed in the first part of this section."
    ],
    "Bedrock Edition[edit | edit source]": [
      "In Bedrock Edition, there are many more types of skin customization. Players can add 3D custom hair, eyes, mouths, arms, legs and more. Players can also change the size of a character. Players can also get many different accessories for the skin. However, the player cannot do this with a custom skin, only with an in-game skin. Players can also buy accessories and skins. Having a skin that is smaller than normal or larger does not affect the hitbox size, but can still give an advantage in multiplayer servers because it can be harder to see them. Some of the skins also do not show their armor or hand-held items."
    ],
    "Legacy Console Edition[edit | edit source]": [
      "Legacy Console Edition refers to the editions of Minecraft for consoles that are developed and updated by 4J Studios.",
      "The Legacy Console Edition was initially announced for the Xbox 360 on June 7, 2011, during E3 2011. Xbox 360 Edition released digitally on May 9, 2012 followed by a physical release on June 4, 2013. The game was later released on additional platforms as PlayStation 3 Edition on December 17, 2013, PlayStation 4 Edition on September 4, 2014, Xbox One Edition on September 5, 2014, PlayStation Vita Edition on October 14, 2014, Wii U Edition on December 17, 2015, and Nintendo Switch Edition on May 11, 2017. As of December 10, 2019, no further feature updates have been released for these versions, and the newest available update depends on the platform. The most recent update on Xbox One Edition and Nintendo Switch Edition is the World of Color Update, while Xbox 360 Edition, PlayStation 3 Edition, PlayStation Vita Edition, and Wii U Edition have access to Update Aquatic. PlayStation 4 Edition is the most up-to-date version with Village & Pillage."

    "Minecraft Education[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft Education (Edition, before late 2022) is an educational version of Minecraft specifically designed for classroom use. It is developed by Mojang Studios and Xbox Game Studios and contains features that make Minecraft easy to use in a classroom setting. The full game was released on November 1, 2016."
    ],
    "New Nintendo 3DS Edition[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition was released on September 13, 2017 for the titular system, its XL variant, and the New Nintendo 2DS XL, a unique port developed by Other Ocean Interactive. Multiplayer was limited to local play. This edition was discontinued on January 15, 2019."
    ],
    "Other[edit | edit source]": [
      "There are a number of other versions of Minecraft. Minecraft 4k is a simple version of Minecraft in the style of other \"4K\" Java games (everything is packaged in 4 kibibytes) by Notch for contests. Minecraft: Pi Edition was a free ported version of Pocket Edition 0.5.0 for the Raspberry Pi,[19] which was intended as an educational tool for novice programmers. It allowed users to manipulate the game code and supported multiple programming languages; however, it was discontinued in January 2016. Minecraft: China Edition is a localized version of Minecraft for mainland China."

    "Edition comparison[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Game customization[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Add-ons[edit | edit source]": [
      "Add-ons‌[Bedrock Edition  only] are the first step toward bringing customization to all editions of Minecraft and are officially supported by Mojang Studios/Minecraft. They currently allow players to transform the look of their worlds, change the behavior of mobs, and add entities, items and blocks, structures, functions and biomes."
    ],
    "Behavior packs[edit | edit source]": [
      "Behavior packs‌[Bedrock Edition  only] dictate how vanilla and custom entities behave, and they can also introduce functions and scripts. When paired with a resource pack designed to complement it, they form an add-on, which allows for the addition of new content to the game."
    ],
    "Resource packs[edit | edit source]": [
      "The game officially supports changing most of its various textures, sounds, and texts through resource packs. Resource packs must contain a certain structure of files and folders placed in the .minecraft/resourcepacks folder. Installed resource packs, as well as the folder in which resource packs are placed, can be accessed in the options menu. The extent to which the resources are changed is dependent on how many files are contained in the resource pack."
    ],
    "Data packs[edit | edit source]": [
      "Data packs‌[Java Edition  only] provide a way for players to further customize vanilla worlds in a similar way to resource packs. Unlike resource packs, which modify the game's resources, data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, recipes and tags without any code modification."
    ],
    "Skins[edit | edit source]": [
      "Skin refers to the texture that is placed onto a player model or mob.\nThe skin is divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). A skin allows only solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in \"holes\" in the skin. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories. Players can also change the arm size to be slim or normal. The slim variant is 3 pixels wide while the normal variant is 4 pixels wide."
    ],
    "Capes[edit | edit source]": [
      "Capes are an uncommon vanity item that can be equipped on a player's back. In Bedrock Edition, players start with a cape that is not equipped by default and some skins come with capes.",
      "Capes also flail around when the player runs. When the player equips elytra, the texture of the elytra changes to an equipped cape."
    ],
    "Unofficial mods[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft can be modified by replacing or adding Java class files to client.jar in Java Edition. This method of making custom modifications is not supported by Mojang as it can break the game if the mod is outdated, defective, or in conflict with another mod. Some such modifications impressed Notch or Jeb sufficiently that they were added to the game and the authors were credited under Additional Programming. Some examples of mods being implemented into the main game include the McRegion mod, Hippoplatimus' Piston Mod and horses from Dr. Zhark's Mo' Creatures mod, being added in Beta 1.3, Beta 1.7 and release 1.6.1 respectively."
    ],
    "Third-party programs[edit | edit source]": [
      "There are many programs designed for Minecraft. These include 3D map editors and viewers, game modifiers, various informational programs (such as crafting recipes) and server wrappers, and other specialty programs. As with mods, these too are not supported by Mojang."
    ],
    "Reception[edit | edit source]": [
      "Metacritic ranked Minecraft as one of the best video games of the 2010s,[20] and Video Game Canon ranks Minecraft as one of the best games of all time.[21]"

    "Quotes[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. Blocks can be used to reshape the world or build fantastical creations. Creatures can be battled or befriended, depending on your playstyle. Experience epic adventures solo or with friends, there’s no wrong way to play.\nUnless you’re digging straight down."

      "The inventory is opened and closed by pressing E on PC,  on Xbox, / on PlayStation, or  on Switch, and ••• on mobile devices. This key or button can be changed from the in-game options menu. The inventory can also be closed with Esc on PC,  most game consoles, / on PlayStation, and × on mobile devices.",

    "Smelting[edit | edit source]": [
      "Smelting can be done in a furnace, smoker, or blast furnace using fuel (e.g. coal) to convert an item into a more useful form, such as turning raw iron into iron ingots. Some food items can also be cooked on a campfire for free."

    "Enchanting[edit | edit source]": [
      "Enchanting allows the player to upgrade tools and armor, with an enchanting table or anvil, but costs experience. Using the enchantment table also costs lapis lazuli.

      "The world is populated with various mobs, including passive and hostile mobs, as well as 2 bosses. Most mobs can be defeated using a sword or any other weapon.",
      "Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (e.g. in a cave, a monster room, a woodland mansion, or at night). Animals and hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player.",
      "Some mobs, including most animals, and even hoglins, can be bred by the player, using their favorite food. Villagers cannot be directly bred by the player. Instead, they randomly breeding on their own, depending on the time of day and the number of beds, which allows players to manipulate their likelihood of breeding."

    "Combat[edit | edit source]": [
      "Most hostile mobs actively seek out and attack the player. Endermen only attack the player if they make eye contact, and piglins attack players who are not wearing golden armor. Endermen also take damage in water and rain. A shield can be used to block most attacks from mobs, and is especially useful against skeletons."
    ],
    "Daylight cycle[edit | edit source]": [
      "It gets dark at night, making monsters spawn on the surface. Sleeping in a bed lets the player skip the night. The day-night cycle lasts 20 real-life minutes, with 10 of those being day and 10 of those being night. There are no seasons, but the moon does have phases."
    ],
    "Game modes[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft has four basic game modes: Survival, Creative, Adventure, and Spectator. Java Edition and Bedrock Edition have one additional game mode, Hardcore, which is a variation of Survival, locked to Hard, where you won't respawn if you die, and has not been added to Minecraft China Edition or Minecraft Education."

    "Creative[edit | edit source]": [
      "This mode is for creating structures and experimenting.",

      "These can be accessed from the Creative inventory."
    ],
    "Survival[edit | edit source]": [
      "In this mode, players must gather all their materials to build things and to craft their items and tools. Also, the experience, health, hunger, armor, and oxygen bars appear above the hotbar. The armor bar only shows when the player is wearing armor. The oxygen bar only appears when underwater, suffocating,‌[BE  only] or in lava.‌[BE  only] If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and respawns at their spawn point.",
      "There are also 4 difficulty settings:",
      "Peaceful: No hostile mobs spawn, and only some neutral mobs spawned. Also, players have natural regeneration, and don't get hungry, making easy survival.\nEasy: Hostile mobs spawn, but deal less damage. Also, villagers cannot be converted into zombie villagers.\nNormal: Hostile mobs spawn, but deal a moderate amount of damage. Villagers can be zombified when killed by zombies, but there is only a 50% chance. They despawn if zombification fails.\nHard: Hostile mobs deal more damage. Villagers always zombify when killed by zombies. Also, zombies can sometimes break down doors and call reinforcements."
    ],
    "Hardcore[edit | edit source]": [
      "In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to \"Hard\", and the player does not respawn after dying. Also, the health bar has different hearts in this mode. After death, the player cannot interact with the world again and must either delete the map or permanently switch to Spectator mode. Hardcore is not technically a game mode as it cannot be enabled with the /gamemode command.",
      "In Java Edition, hardcore can be selected in the game mode selector.\nIn Bedrock Edition, hardcore appears as a toggle, and can be found right below the difficult selector."
    ],
    "Adventure[edit | edit source]": [
      "Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons, and can interact with mobs. However, they can break blocks only with certain tools, and place only certain blocks, as determined by the designer. This mode is good for adventure maps."

    "Spectator[edit | edit source]": [
      "When in Spectator mode, players can clip through blocks and fly freely. The player can't interact with blocks, entities or their inventory.",

      "In Java Edition, the player can enter the perspective of other entities by left-clicking on them, and are invisible to all players and mobs except for other spectators. When in third-person mode, a player appears as a transparent floating head. The player can use the scroll wheel to adjust the flying speed, unlike flying in Creative mode."

It should be noted that articles about specific mods or similar things are outside the scope of the Minecraft Wiki. However, the wiki does document various technical features about the data format used in resource packs and data packs."

      "Minecraft can be played in a wide variety of other ways too.",
      "Players can use the game as a creative medium for story-telling and roleplay.\nThe game can also be used as a competitive space. Some examples:\nThe Minecraft minigame, Spleef.\nPlayer versus Player (PvP).\nVarious types of Custom maps.\nMods, add-ons, and data packs and can also be used to make other games inside of Minecraft. However, Minecraft is not a \"game engine\". Anyone making Mods, add-ons, or data packs should make sure to follow the guidelines outlined in the End-User License Agreement.",

    "Players[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player is the person (or player character) that the user controls in the world. When the user starts a game or save, the player spawns at the world spawn, with an empty inventory.",
      "Each player can also have a skin, which determines what the player character looks like. A player can change their skin on their profile page on Minecraft.net or in the Minecraft Launcher in Java Edition, and in the pause or main menus in Bedrock Edition."
    ],
    "Blocks[edit | edit source]": [
      "The world of Minecraft takes place within a three-dimensional grid of cubes, with each cube being occupied by a certain type of block. There are many types of blocks. For example, natural blocks, such as grass, stone and ores that generate randomly within the world. Or blocks that players can craft, such as the crafting table and furnace. Most of these blocks can then by mined, by hand or with tools. Some blocks cannot be broken in Survival, such as bedrock, end portal frames, command blocks, and barriers."
    ],
    "Mining[edit | edit source]": [
      "Mining is one of the main aspects of Minecraft and is done to extract ore and other materials mainly from below the surface of the map. These ores include coal, iron, gold, redstone, diamond, lapis lazuli, copper and emerald. Mining can involve digging a hole from the surface or going down through a cave. Mineshafts and ravines create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores."
    ],
    "Health[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player has 20HP × 10 hitpoints, called health. The player loses health upon taking damage, and dies when they run out of health. Health can be restored by keeping the hunger bar full enough, by drinking potions of Healing, or by eating golden apples. In Peaceful mode, health quickly regenerates on its own. Damage can be reduced by wearing armor or having the Resistance effect."
    ],
    "Armor[edit | edit source]": [
      "Armor protects the player from damage by decreasing all incoming damage by a percentage. When the player is wearing armor, the armor bar becomes visible above the health bar, and displays how much armor the player has. Each  chestplate on the armor bar represents 2 armor points."
    ],
    "Hunger[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player has 20 points of hunger, which can be seen on the hunger bar. Each  ham shank represents 2 hunger points. Eating food increases hunger points. Despite the name, having more hunger points means the player is less hungry (and therefore more satiated). 18 hunger () is required for natural health regeneration, and 6 hunger () is required in order to sprint, so keeping the hunger bar full is usually a good idea. Hunger depletes when the player does things (usually things that should require a lot of work), like jumping and sprinting.",
      "The hunger status effect should not be confused with hunger points."
    ],
    "Experience[edit | edit source]": [
      "Experience (EXP or XP for short) can be gained from defeating mobs or performing many kinds of other actions. Experience has no direct effect on the player character, but it can be used to enhance their equipment through enchanting, or by using an anvil to repair, rename, or combine enchantments on equipment. Most sources of experience are produced in the form of experience orbs. In Java Edition, experience gained affects the player's score on the death screen."
    ],
    "HUD[edit | edit source]": [
      "The heads-up display is the GUI displayed over the game world. It includes a hotbar, and shows the player's held item on the right of the screen."
    ],
    "Hotbar[edit | edit source]": [
      "The hotbar is a sequence of 9 selectable inventory slots that the player can store items in. The player can use various buttons to select or cycle through these slots. The selected item is then displayed as the held item in the player's right hand, or an empty fist if the slot is empty. The selected can then be used, using the same buttons the player would use to mine a block or use a crafting table (on mobile, a special button might appear and the player can press that button to use the item)."
    ],
    "Chat[edit | edit source]": [
      "Chat is a built-in messaging system used to communicate with other players, and to execute commands. By default, the player can press T or ↵ Enter on a keyboard,  on touchscreen,‌[BE & edu  only] or  on controllers‌[BE  only] to open the chat."
    ],
    "Effects[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player can obtain various status effects in various ways. For example, golden apples give Absorption and Regeneration. Some status effects, like Regeneration, can buff the player to make them stronger, while others, like Slowness can debuff the player to make them weaker. Also, some mobs give the player status effects. For example, shulkers give Levitation and wardens give Darkness."
    ],
    "Riding[edit | edit source]": [
      "The player can ride various mobs, by using the same button they would to use a crafting table (or by pressing \"Mount\" on mobile). These include horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, striders, and happy ghasts. Players can also ride in boats and minecarts in the same way. Most of these mobs and vehicles can be controlled by the player, but some mobs require a saddle, harness, carrot on a stick, warped fungus on a stick to ride or control. Additionally, some mobs must be tamed by the player in order to be ridden or controlled."
    ],
    "Achievements[edit | edit source]": [
      "Achievements in Bedrock Edition and Advancements in Java Edition are ways to gradually guide new players into Minecraft and give them challenges to complete. For example, \"The Lie\" is given for crafting a cake. In Bedrock Edition, completing certain achievements rewards the player with cosmetics. There are many exclusive achievements and advancements that only exist in one edition of the game, while other achievements and advancements are shared."
    ],
    "Dimensions[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Overworld[edit | edit source]": [
      "The Overworld is the first dimension where the player spawns when the world is created. Most of the game's features exist primarily in the Overworld; it is filled brim with many biomes, features, and a variety of caves to explore."
    ],
    "The Nether[edit | edit source]": [
      "The Nether is a dangerous, hell-like dimension with very hostile environment. It is accessible from the Overworld by going through a nether portal. It consists of five unique biomes: the nether wastes, the basalt deltas, the crimson forest, the warped forest and the soul sand valley. Each biome has unique generation and terrain. The Nether is populated with zombified piglins, blazes, ghasts, wither skeletons, magma cubes, piglins and hoglins. Ores in the Nether include nether quartz, nether gold ore, and ancient debris. The Nether also has large oceans of lava with striders walking on them."
    ],
    "The End[edit | edit source]": [
      "The End is the final dimension of the game, where the player battles the ender dragon. The End is accessed by entering an end portal, found in a stronghold. The End is composed of end stone and is inhabited by endermen. It also contains tall obsidian pillars on top of which are end crystals that heal the ender dragon. Once the ender dragon is slain, the exit portal is opened in the center of the main island and an end gateway portal is created in the air near the edge of the island. Gateways transport the player to the outer End islands, which are have chorus fruit forests, and end cities filled with loot and shulkers. Also, some end cities have elytra. The gateway is 1 block tall, so it can only be entered by throwing an ender pearl, using elytra, or crawling via a trapdoor or some other means. There are no ores in the End."

    "Multiplayer[edit | edit source]": [],
    "Servers[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft can be played with multiple players in one world using servers hosting a game. Players can connect to external servers through the Internet, or host a server themselves. Minecraft multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their administrators and moderators. The term griefer, meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet but has taken up its definition on Minecraft servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users' creations on servers.",
      "One popular game on multiplayer servers is Spleef (a play on the word \"grief\"), a game where the player aims to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent's feet. This is typically played in a designated area and is usually run automatically using server plugins.",
      "Many popular multiplayer servers exist that may contain, PvP arenas, custom minigames or large Survival or Creative worlds. In Bedrock Edition, the player can access a few featured servers without needing to manually add them to quickly get started on multiplayer servers. An official server list has been made for well-known and popular other servers."
    ],
    "Minecraft Realms[edit | edit source]": [
      "Minecraft Realms is an official subscription-based server hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private Minecraft multiplayer worlds. Hosted by Mojang Studios, Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the internet. However, Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.[1] Private Realms servers are easy to set up and available 24/7 as long as the owner pays for it."
    ],
    "LAN and Xbox connections[edit | edit source]": [
      "Players can also play Minecraft together using LAN connections. When a world is opened for multiplayer (by default in Bedrock Edition), other players on the same network can join the world without needing to add an address. This can be used to play Minecraft together locally with a smaller group of people.",
      "In Bedrock Edition players can also join worlds from other players without needing to be connected to the same network or making a server, by using the Xbox friend system. A player can add friends through the Friends tab in the menus or in the pause screen of a world. A player may invite friends and friends of friends to a world when the player is logged in with their Microsoft account and connected to the Internet."

Players craft by arranging items in the crafting grid to match a given recipe. Small crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there, including wooden planks, sticks, crafting tables, and torches.",

This brings up an interface with a larger 3×3 crafting grid in which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game. Recipes fitting the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table's 3×3 grid. There is a recipe book button in the inventory where the player can access all of their unlocked crafting recipes.",

When items are put into a crafter automatically they fill every enabled slot equally from left to right and top to bottom, in that order.

      "There are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:",
      "Using an enchanting table, place an unenchanted item and lapis lazuli in their respective slots, and apply an enchantment at the cost of experience.\nUsing an anvil, combine an enchanted book with an item.\nUsing an anvil, combine two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.\nA librarian villager may enchant books in exchange for emeralds, granting the player experience just like every trade.",
      "A player may also obtain items already enchanted:",
      "A villager may trade some enchanted items for emeralds.\nFishing gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.\nA zombie, drowned, husk, piglin, skeleton, bogged, stray, wither skeleton, and zombified piglin, if it has an enchanted item and is killed by a player, has an 8.5% chance to drop each individual item.\nTreasure chests in locations such as end cities, ancient cities, shipwrecks, mineshafts, monster rooms, desert pyramids, jungle pyramids, woodland mansions, ocean ruins, strongholds, ruined portals, pillager outposts, and bastion remnants may contain enchanted items.\nTo barter with piglins, give them gold, and they have a small chance to drop an enchanted book or iron boots with the Soul Speed enchantment (random level 1-3).\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators in raids may drop enchanted items.",
      "Server operators and players in singleplayer worlds with cheats enabled can also enchant items using commands such as /enchant. When enchanted with the /give command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In Creative mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and enchanted books, with no experience points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the \"Search\" tab.",

    ],
    "Enchanting table[edit | edit source]": [
      "An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item and 1–3 lapis lazuli in the input slots. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs, written in Standard Galactic Alphabet, do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied. On mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release. The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 30 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.",
      "Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.",
      "The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, it is possible for multiple different enchantments to be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. However, certain selected enchants never give any additional enchantment, regardless of which tool is enchanted, such as Efficiency IV and Knockback II.‌[BE  only][verify]",
      "To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves can be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a minimum of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the Enchantment Mechanics page for more detailed information on this.",
      "Enchanting a book produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively \"saves\" the enchantment for later application to another item with an anvil.",
      "Unlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero."
    ],
    "Affecting offered enchantments[edit | edit source]": [
      "Enchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 level could be spent to enchant a book or a different tool to refresh the list.",
      "The possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30). The following actions do not affect the possible enchantments:",
      "removing the item and putting it back in\nclicking on the item slot with a different item\nusing a different item of the same type and material\nreplacing or moving the table (but keeping the same number of bookshelves)\nusing a different table with the same number of bookshelves, or\nreplacing or rearranging the bookshelves without changing their total number.",
      "Changing the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not \"better\" or \"worse\" based on the row despite the different resource costs."
    ],
    "Anvil combinations[edit | edit source]": [
      "An anvil can be used to combine the enchantments of two items, sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. The items must be compatible; they must either be the same type and material (such as two iron swords) or an item and an enchanted book with an applicable enchantment (such as a bow and an Infinity enchanted book).",
      "Combining two enchanted items, books or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum allowed in Survival mode; for example, a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking II combined with a book with Unbreaking II produces a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking III.",
      "To combine items, the player places the target item in the anvil's first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot. If the combination is allowed, the resulting enchanted item appears in the anvil's output slot and an experience level cost, labeled \"Enchantment Cost\", appears below (green if the player has enough experience levels, red if they don't). To complete the enchanting, the player removes the enchanted item from the anvil's output slot, and their experience level is reduced accordingly.",
      "The experience cost depends on the enchantments, with highly enchanted items costing more. If the target item is also being repaired, that costs more as well. The target item can also be renamed, at additional cost. There is also an accumulating surcharge for prior work done on anvils. In Survival mode, work that costs more than 39 levels of experience is refused although it may still be possible to perform the same work in steps. For example, a damaged enchanted bow may be repaired on an anvil with an ordinary bow, and then another enchanted bow may be used to combine enchantments with the repaired bow."

    "Enchanted books[edit | edit source]": [
      "Enchanted books can be made by enchanting a book in an enchanting table at the cost of experience points. They can also be found in the chests of several structures, purchased with emeralds from a librarian villager, or caught while fishing.",
      "Enchanted books can be applied to tools, weapons, and armor, or combined with other enchanted books in an anvil. In this way, some enchantments that cannot normally be obtained on an item through use of the enchanting table can still be applied to those items, such as applying Thorns to boots.",
      "Although enchanted books can have multiple enchantments of any type, only enchantments appropriate to a given item type are applied to that item when combined in an anvil. For example, an enchanted book may have both the Respiration and Power enchantments, but the Respiration enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a helmet. Likewise, the Power enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a bow.",
      "In Creative mode, enchanted books can be used to apply any enchantment to any item, such as a stick having Knockback II on Java Edition. However, mutually-exclusive enchantments, such as Infinity and Mending, cannot be applied this way or even via /enchant (though both enchantments function as normal when obtained on a bow through the /give command).",
      "The experience costs for using books are considerably less than for combining items with similar enchantments since the books themselves cost levels to create. However, it's still an extra cost, and enchanting items directly has a chance to get multiple enchantments. The advantage of books is that they can be stockpiled for use on an item of choice and allow for controlled combinations. For example, a Silk Touch book can be used on an axe, pickaxe, or shovel, and the player can decide which item receives which enchantment."

When cheats are disabled, these commands can't be used unless executed by a server or a script, even if the executor has a high permission level.\nIn Java Edition, whether cheats are enabled only affects the permission level of a player.

      "In Java Edition, in singleplayer worlds where cheats were not enabled at creation, they can be enabled on a temporary basis by opening the current game session to LAN play ( Esc → \"Open to LAN\", then \"Allow Cheats\" button and \"Start LAN World\"). The player does not actually need to be on a LAN or have others join. This is not permanent but allows the use of commands until the player quits the world, and changes the player makes via commands (items spawned, etc.) are saved with the world. The player can do this each time the player starts playing the world again. Note that this disables game pausing for the duration, so while open to LAN, the player should get somewhere safe or reload their world before using the Game Menu. The player can disable the LAN world by reloading the world. To permanently enable cheats, the level.dat file has to be edited.",

    "Parsing and execution[edit | edit source]": [
      "The command performing on the server side is divided into two stages: command parsing and command execution. During the command parsing stage, the game identifies the string as a command and checks whether the command is complete and whether arguments are specified correctly. During the command execution stage, the command fulfills its purpose.",
      "When typing a command in the chat, or command block, the command is also be parsed in the client side first to provide autocompletion and help the player detect typing mistakes.",
      "In Bedrock Edition, when entering into a command block, the command is parsed on the server side once the command block screen is closed. If the command is unparseable in the server side, a syntax error message is outputted into its output box.",
      "When attempting to execute an unparseable command, an error message is displayed.",
      "Commands in functions are all parsed when loading the function. If any command in a function file is unparseable, the function cannot be loaded by the game. In Java Edition, macro lines are parsed when attempting to run the function, see also Function (Java Edition) § Macros and Function (Java Edition) § Loading and parsing.",

    "Output[edit | edit source]": [
      "After trying to execute a command, it may yield output values, including success count and stored values‌[Java Edition  only].",
      "Success count is the value a command passes to the command block executing it. A command block can power a redstone comparator facing away from it (may be separated by a block) with signal strength being the success count. The signal strength reflects the success count of the last command executed. Even after the command block is deactivated, the success count is retained until the command is executed again. In Bedrock Edition, the success count is also returned to the script executing the command. In Java Edition, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks have no success count. In Bedrock Edition, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks or scripts still have a success count, but it cannot be obtained. In Java Edition, success count is always 0 or 1, except the /execute command. In Bedrock Edition, success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (both inclusive) related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, etc.)",
      "Stored values‌[JE  only] include success value and result value, which are the values passed by other commands to the /execute command, when a command is executed by a /execute command. These two values can be stored to a specified location by the store subcommand in the /execute command. The success value is always 0 or 1. The result value is an integer (rounded down if not). All commands may yield these two stored values after execution, with only two exceptions: /execute command itself does not yield these two stored values; /function command may not yield these two stored values in certain situation."
